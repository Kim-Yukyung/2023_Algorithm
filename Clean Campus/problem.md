## Problem
Compute how much silk was required to complete task.
<br> 
<br> The senior classman tied the silk to a stake, walked around the perimeter of the area containing the frosh, 
<br> drawing the silk taut to encircle all of them, and then returned to the stake, using the minimum amount of silk necessary.
<br> 
<br> You may assume that the stake is at coordinates (0, 0).
<br> 
<br> The coordinates of the frosh are given in meters relative to the stake, and there are no more than 100 frosh.
<br> 
<br> Write C programming code using **Graham's scan algorithm**.

## Input
The input begins with the number of frosh, followed by one line per frosh with two real numbers given his or her position.
<br>
<br> There is a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

## Output
For each test case, the output consists of a single number: the length of silk in meters to two decimal places.

## Sample Input
4
<br> 1.0 1.0
<br> -1.0 1.0
<br> -1.0 -1.0
<br> 1.0 -1.0

## Sample Output
10.83
