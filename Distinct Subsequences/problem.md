## Problem
Write a program that counts the number of occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence such that each has a distinct index sequence.

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating the number of test cases to follow.
<br> 
<br> The first line of each test case contains a string X, composed entirely of lowercase alphabetic characters and having length 
<br> no greater than 10,000.
<br> 
<br> The second line contains another string Z having length no greater than 100 and composed of lowercase alphabetic characters.

## Output
For each test case, output the number of distinct occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence.

## Sample Input
2
<br> babgbag
<br> bag
<br> rabbbit
<br> rabbit

## Sample Output
5
<br> 3
