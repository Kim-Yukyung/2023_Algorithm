## Problem
How to connect the dots so as to minimize the amount of ink used.
<br> 
<br> Connect the dots by drawing straight lines between pairs, possibley lifting the pen between lines.
<br> 
<br> When finished, there must be a sequence of connected lines from any dot to any other dot.

## Input
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of dots (0 < n < 30) on drawing paper.
<br> 
<br> For each dots, a line follows; each following line contains two real numbers indicating the (x, y) coordinates of the dots.

## Output
Print a single real number to two decimal places: the minimum total length of ink lines that can connect all the dots.

## Sample Input
3
<br> 1.0 1.0
<br> 2.0 2.0
<br> 2.0 4.0

## Sample Output
3.41
